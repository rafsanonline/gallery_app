## Introduction

This is a simple app for fetching a list of photos from the Unplash server. They provide free API(s) for high-quality photos.

## App structure

I've set up a clean architecture with MVVM design pattern to develop this app with the latest android jetpack components.
The main components of the app are following:

1. Jetpack Compose
2. View model
3. Hilt
4. Flow
5. Room Database
6. Paging

Jetpack compose is the latest UI toolkit provided by android which comes with no XML.

## Testing

I've used Junit4 for performing the caching data store testing in the room database.
Google truth library has been used to evaluate the values of the test results.
